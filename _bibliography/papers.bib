   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly becoming a common tool in computational chemistry. At the same time, the rapid development of ML methods requires a flexible software framework for designing custom workflows. MLatom 3 is a program package designed to leverage the power of ML to enhance typical computational chemistry simulations and to create complex workflows. This open-source package provides plenty of choice to the users who can run simulations with the command-line options, input files, or with scripts using MLatom as a Python package, both on their computers and on the online XACS cloud computing service at XACScloud.com. Computational chemists can calculate energies and thermochemical properties, optimize geometries, run molecular and quantum dynamics, and simulate (ro)vibrational, one-photon UV/vis absorption, and two-photon absorption spectra with ML, quantum mechanical, and combined models. The users can choose from an extensive library of methods containing pretrained ML models and quantum mechanical approximations such as AIQM1 approaching coupled-cluster accuracy. The developers can build their own models using various ML algorithms. The great flexibility of MLatom is largely due to the extensive use of the interfaces to many state-of-the-art software packages and libraries.},

   abstract = {Molecules with strong two-photon absorption (TPA) are important in many advanced applications such as upconverted laser and photodynamic therapy, but their design is hampered by the high cost of experimental screening and accurate quantum chemical (QC) calculations. Here a systematic study is performed by collecting an experimental TPA database with approximately 900 molecules, analyzing with interpretable machine learning (ML) the key molecular features explaining TPA magnitudes, and building a fast ML model for predictions. The ML model has prediction errors of similar magnitude compared to experimental and affordable QC methods errors and has the potential for high-throughput screening as additionally validated with the new experimental measurements. ML feature analysis is generally consistent with common beliefs which is quantified and rectified. The most important feature is conjugation length followed by features reflecting the effects of donor and acceptor substitution and coplanarity.},
